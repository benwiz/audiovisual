# av-shader-pi

## What

Python based environment for populating shader textures with video and audio.

## Why

I wanted a small, audio-reactive, portable camera with hdmi output visualizer to plug into a tv.

## How

Python based scripts to interface with Raspberry Pi camera and audio input and to render glsl shaders.

## Status

It works but is extremely laggy. Still worth some furhter exploration.

## To Do

- Read shaders from external files
- Easy cli arguments to point to shader files
- Incorporate audio
