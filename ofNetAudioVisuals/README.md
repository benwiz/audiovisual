#  netAudioVisual

## What

OpenFrameworks (C++) based audio visualizer. Focus on 3D drawing using a "net".

## How

Using the "packet" configuring seen in my other OpenFrameworks projects. Some audio frames are consumed, analyzed, then sent to the game loop.

## Status

Inactive.

### Retrospective

As much as I'd rather use another tool OpenFrameworks is excellent.

## To Do

- Don't use wireFrame, use a shader

- Consider including onset detection for emphasis
- X, Y, and Z movements can all use different metrics
- Control some parameters with OSC controller on my phone!
