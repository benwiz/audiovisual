# ofMusicVisualizer

## What

OpenFrameworks (C++) based audio visualizer. Very early attempt.

## How

Using the "packet" configuring seen in my other OpenFrameworks projects. Some audio frames are consumed, analyzed, then sent to the game loop.

## Status

Inactive.

### Retrospective

As much as I'd rather use another tool OpenFrameworks is excellent.
