Listener gets audio packets. Then passes them to canvas. Canvas during the draw cycle draws.

## To Do

- Don't do immediate updates, vertices should move with some decay or stickiness

- Consider including onset detection for emphasis
- X, Y, and Z movements can all use different metrics
- Control some parameters with OSC controller on my phone!
