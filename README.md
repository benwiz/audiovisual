## Notes

- (All algorithm implementation)[https://github.com/leozimmerman/ofxAudioAnalyzer/blob/master/example-allAlgorithms/src/ofApp.cpp]


## Ideas

- Run on different scales

## To Do

- Figure out the right way to organize the code base to explore different approaches

- Approaches to try:
  - Draw onsets with pitch (current setup)
  - Draw melBands as if there were a staff and `if onset == true` emphasize it some way
