## Notes

- (All algorithm implementation)[https://github.com/leozimmerman/ofxAudioAnalyzer/blob/master/example-allAlgorithms/src/ofApp.cpp]


## Ideas

- Run on different scales

## To Do

- Determine whether the onset is a low, mid, or high
- Maybe I should use mel bands and each mel band (or set of mel bands) gets its own shape or row on a staff
